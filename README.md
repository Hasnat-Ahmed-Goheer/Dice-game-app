## Overview

Welcome to the Dice Roller Game, a thrilling two-player game of strategy and luck! In this JavaScript-based game, your objective is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points.

## How to Play 🎯

1. The game starts with Player 1 🧑 rolling the dice 🎲. The number rolled is added to their current score.
2. Player 1 can choose to "Hold" their current score, passing the turn to Player 2 🧑. Alternatively, they can continue rolling the dice.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to zero 🙅‍♂️, and the turn passes to the other player.
4. The game continues with players taking turns rolling and deciding whether to hold or keep rolling.
5. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game! 🥳

## Strategy 🧠

The game is a balance of risk and reward. Should you keep rolling to accumulate more points, or play it safe by holding your current score? Be careful not to roll a 1 and lose all your progress! 😬
